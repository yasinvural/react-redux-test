# react-redux-test

This is sample react redux project. There are two basic and simple components which are counter and todo.

My aim is just learning the redux. How to create store, action and reducers. What are the relations between them. To clarify, just create this repo.

To be able to use this repo,

1) git clone https://github.com/yasinvural/react-redux-test.git

2) cd react-redux-test

3) npm install

4) npm install --save redux

5) npm start

6) http://localhost:3000/
